## 🚧 What This Project Explores

Collision is a real-time physics sandbox that digs into the essentials of game engineering.  
Everything—motion, collisions, audio—is computed manually without relying on external tools.

This project focuses on **first principles engineering**, including:

- Collision resolution  
- Momentum conservation  
- Particle physics  
- Procedural audio  
- High-FPS rendering  

No shortcuts. No frameworks.  
Just engineering.

## 🔥 Features

| Feature | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Custom Physics Core** | Hand-rolled impulse resolution, friction, drag, and normal vector calculations. |
| **Procedural Sound Engine** | Fully generated via the Web Audio API—oscillators, noise buffers, envelopes. |
| **Particle Explosion System** | Shards inherit velocity, angle, and energy from parent bodies. |
| **Game Feel Enhancements** | Algorithmic screen shake, shockwave distortion, hit-feedback “juice.” |
| **Smooth 60 FPS** | Optimized Canvas rendering loop with `requestAnimationFrame`. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — core logic  
- **HTML5 Canvas** — rendering pipeline  
- **Web Audio API** — procedural audio synthesis  
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)** — lightweight UI styling  

The entire simulation is contained in a **single HTML file**.
